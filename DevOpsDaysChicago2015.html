    <h1>Presentation Notes</h1>
    <h2>Keynote 1: State of DevOps fro John WIllis</h2>
    <p>
      There are a lot of books to look into that appear to be amazing, especially around complexity.
      Investigate Generative Organizations and Westrum Model.
      High performers are getting better at success and recovery. If you deliver 30x a low performer in 2013 you were 3x their success and 48x the recovery. In 2014 it was 60x success and 140x recovery!
      Need to get DevOps Enterprise on my radar.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a good presentation with a lot of passion. A survey of where DevOps is and what is upcoming with a full list of further reading material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Topics to investigate:
      <ul>
        <li>Get slides and process book.</li>
        <li>Data Gravity</li>
        <li>Generative Organization</li>
        <li>Westrum Model</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Talk 1: Microservices at Orbitz by Steve Hoffman</h2>
    <p>
      I know most of this stuff as a principal implementer; light notes.
      Our old way had a "backlog of backlash".
    </p>

    <h2>Talk 2: Bootstrapping an ops team by Charity Majors</h2>
    <p>
      The first question is "Do you really need an ops team?" Many teams do not need a team. If you are a small DevOps team you do not need a team, but someone who cares about infrastructure on their team. However once all the team is working on is infrastructure they <em>might</em> need an operations team.
      Operations engineering is not "software engineering lite". It is a skill that needs to be brought into your team when needed and you have hard problems. It is likely that you need your dev teams to learn more about operations. You need to have "hard" problems to have the best operations teams.

      Facebook only builds problem to scale to 10x because they assume there will be a rewrite before that. If you do not you will make too many poor decisions. 

      When hiring someone you are likely to want a unicorn, but you don't et a unicorn. Instead determine what the traits (not skills) that you need in people and hire for that. 

      Things that do not predicts a good operations engineer:
      <ul>
        <li>Great at white-boarding code</li>
        <li>Any particular technology or language</li>
        <li>Any particular pedigree</li>
        <li>Big company pedigree</li>
      </ul>
      I would say this is true for software engineers also.

      Success at a big company does not predict success at a small company.

      Learned helplessness is kryptonite for a startup. 
      Prefer recommendations over an interview.

    <p>This talk was too much "operations" is separate from </p>
    <p>
      Topics to investigate:
      <ul>
        <li>Do we have hard problems that necessitate an ops team?</li>
        <li>Book: The hard thing about hard things</li>
        <li>Do we praise people for the behaviour we want? And never praise harmful behaviour.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Talk 3: Brainstorming Failure by Jeff Smith from Grubhub</h2>
    <p>
      Absence of errors is not feedback.
      Crossfunctional teams are essential to ensure the right type of feedback is being generated that is focused on the end-user.
      Process:
      <ol>
        <li>Brainstorm all the potential failures</li>
        <li>List out the effects of the failures</li>
        <li>Agree on Risk Level Scales</li>
        <li>Assign Severity Ranking</li>
        <li>Assign liklihood</li>
        <li>Assign Detection Ranking</li>
        <li><em>This is an incomplete list. Look at presentation</em></li>

      </ol>
      Calculate your RPN
    </p>

    <p>He is a great speaker. </p>
    <p>
      Topics to investigate:
      <ul>
        <li>FMEA: Failure Mode Effects Analysis</li>
        <li>Tool: Doc that helps calculate RPN</li>
        <li>Go Teams should calculate RPN</li>
        <li>It would be interesting to use this for the WL development process.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
