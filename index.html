    <h1>Welcome to my new site!</h1>
    <p>I am trying to set up a new blog site from scratch to help learn more about the AWS service offerings and to share what I know and how I can help IT organizations. I want to document the process as much as possible. There is going to be a lot of churn at first.</p>
    <p>To start with I have followed the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html">Setting Up a Static Website Using a Custom Domain</a> walk-through at AWS. I registered <a href="http://tomawtech.com">tomawtech.com</a> with <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a>. I have also setup <a href="https://github.com/scttnlsn/dandelion">dandelion</a> to synchronize the <a href="https://github.com/flatiron32/tomawtechdotcom">Github repository</a> that holds the source for this site.</p>
    <p>Here is the example <a href="https://github.com/flatiron32/tomawtechdotcom/blob/master/dandelion.yml.tmpl">dandelion.yml</a> file. I do not keep the actual dandelion file in Github because it has my AWS Secret Key in it. I am investigating how to keep this stored encrypted in plain sight.</p>
    <p>I also had to move my nameserver over to Route 53 by creating a new <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html#Step_CreateHostedZone">Hosted Zone</a>. This allowed me to learn a lot about name records than I knew before.</p>
