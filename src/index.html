            <h1>Continuous Integration!</h1>
            <p>I initially had this site synchronized with my S3 Bucket using the <a href="https://github.com/scttnlsn/dandelion">dandelion</a> tool. However that meant that I had to execute a separate command to deploy the code. 
            <pre>git add index.html
git commit -m "Added great content about the new work I am doing"
git push
dandelion deploy #Grrrrr</pre> 
            While one more command may not appear to be a lot. It is a 25% increase. That increase is also very risky as it is for a tool that is not part of my normal tool-chain. I know I will forget how to use it with any pause in use. Finally, automation is a first order feature of any product. I cannot automate the git commands, but I can automate deployments. 
            </p>
            <p>At first I search in vain for a tool that would work for me. My initial path was a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/dynamic-github-actions-with-aws-lambda/">complicated GitHub webhook to an AWS Lambda function</a>. While that sounds cool and I would have learned a lot, my gut told me that was way too complicated. I also looked at using <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/how-to-push-revision.html">CodeDeploy</a> and a lot of other dead ends. Eventually my GoogleFu was successful after a tweet begging for help. </p>

              I found <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/continuous-deployment-static-website-aws-snapci">instructions</a> to use <a href="https://snap-ci.com">Snap CI</a> to do deployments. I also discovered that <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/s3/">Travis CI can do the same thing.</a></p>
            <p>
              I now have a very simple pipeline in Snap CI that will deploy to S3. The important bit is the command that the stage will run.
              <pre>aws s3 sync . s3://tomawtech.com --exclude .gitignore --exclude README.md --acl public-read --region us-east-1 --delete</pre>
              Snap CI put in some good defaults, but it was still useful to check the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/sync.html">AWS S3 sync documentation</a>. The pipeline is setup to run with every commit and I will be notified if something bad ever happens. I can also see the status on the site's repository <a href="https://github.com/flatiron32/tomawtechdotcom">home page</a>.

              <strong>In other news</strong> I added <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> to the site with <a href="https://bootswatch.com/united/">united</a> theme from Bootswatch. I still have a lot to learn about Bootstrap.

            <h1>Welcome to my new site!</h1>
            <p>I am trying to set up a new blog site from scratch to help learn more about the AWS service offerings and to share what I know and how I can help IT organizations. I want to document the process as much as possible. There is going to be a lot of churn at first.</p>
            <p>To start with I have followed the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html">Setting Up a Static Website Using a Custom Domain</a> walk-through at AWS. I registered <a href="http://tomawtech.com">tomawtech.com</a> with <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a>. I have also setup <a href="https://github.com/scttnlsn/dandelion">dandelion</a> to synchronize the <a href="https://github.com/flatiron32/tomawtechdotcom">Github repository</a> that holds the source for this site.</p>
            <p>Here is the example <a href="https://github.com/flatiron32/tomawtechdotcom/blob/master/dandelion.yml.tmpl">dandelion.yml</a> file. I do not keep the actual dandelion file in Github because it has my AWS Secret Key in it. I am investigating how to keep this stored encrypted in plain sight.</p>
            <p>I also had to move my nameserver over to Route 53 by creating a new <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html#Step_CreateHostedZone">Hosted Zone</a>. This allowed me to learn a lot about name records than I knew before.</p>
